**Air Travel Safety**

Data Analysis and Visualization

**Languages Used**

- **Python**
- **R**
- **PowerBI**
- **Tableau**

**Introduction**

A Data Visualization course in my Master's Program involved a semester project where we had to showcase a few different types of data visualizations bi-weekly. We used Python, R, PowerBI or Tableau to generate the following:

- Barchart
- Piechart
- Linechart
- Stepchart
- Treemap
- Area and Stacked Area Chart
- Scatterplot
- Bubble Plot
- Density Map
- Contour Plot
- Heatmap
- Spatial Map
- Funnel Chart
- Histogram
- Boxplot
- Bullet Chart
- Waterfall Chart

**Air Travel Safety**

The term project asks you to play a role of data analyst for an airline and come up with data visualization/proof to campaign against a false media narrative of frequent and deadly airplane crashes and questionable air safety concerns. The following is a list of required deliverables for the project we were asked to produce:

- Deliverables for internal audience:
  - Data Visualization with detailed analysis
  - Executive Summary

- Deliverables for external audience:
  - Infographic
  - Blog Post
  - Presentation

**Blog Post**

The following is a link to my Blog Post I created for external audience to combat the false media narrative: [https://phhands1517.blogspot.com/2023/02/it-is-still-safer-to-fly-in-sky.html](https://phhands1517.blogspot.com/2023/02/it-is-still-safer-to-fly-in-sky.html)

**Infographic**

I created the below infographic that includes data visualizations and detailed analysis.
